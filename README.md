It's an action game made in 48 (non-consecutive) hours for [Miz Jam 1] ( Itch.io ).
### Story

In a very near future the polluted earth lost almost completly the vegetation on it, making the primary resources such as food and water more valuable than money, making the big corporations fought for control them.
